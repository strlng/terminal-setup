# terminal-setup

Bash script to set up Terminal.app in macOS the way I like it. Have the start of the settings for Linux as well.

Requires [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew) for the macOS stuff.

Script grabs [base16](http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/) vim colors from [base16-vim](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim). Grabs iTerm colors from [base16-iterm2](https://github.com/martinlindhe/base16-iterm2), and [iterm2terminal.swift](https://github.com/lysyi3m/osx-terminal-themes/blob/master/tools/iterm2terminal.swift) from [osx-terminal-themes](https://github.com/lysyi3m/osx-terminal-themes) so the iTerm theme can be converted for macOS Terminal.
